# Linear-Regression-from-Scratch
• This project showcases the internal workings of Linear Regression models.
• Implemented Linear Regression from scratch on a Kaggle dataset without using libraries like Scikit-Learn.
• Manually derived the cost function, implemented gradient descent, and updated weights and biases.
• Applied mathematical operations and core machine learning fundamentals to achieve strong model accuracy.
